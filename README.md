Admin Dashboard project from The Odin Project to practice CSS Grid

**Live Preview** [https://mmjordan11.github.io/adminDashboard/](https://mmjordan11.github.io/adminDashboard/)

## Skills Practiced
- Using CSS grid to position elements of a complex webpage layout.
- Implementing SVG images into webpage design.

## Reflection
1. This project was completed mostly as a review of HTML & CSS after taking approximately 9 months off from coding.
2. I learned a lot more about some new features in grid (ie: minmax, min-content, max-content, clamp, auto-fit & auto-fill).
3. Commit early and often!
4. I feel confident that given a page design, I can recreate it with HTML & CSS.
